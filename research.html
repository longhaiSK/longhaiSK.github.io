<h2 align="left">Overview of Prof. Li's Research Activities</h2>


<p>Prof. Li's research focuses on developing and applying statistical machine-learning methods to analyze bioinformatics and epidemiology data. His research activities are computationally intensive, aiming to develop new data analysis software and solve real problems in life and health sciences.  </p>



<h3>Model Diagnostics and Comparison</h3>

He aims to develop new tools for evaluating Bayesian/non-Bayesian models with complex structures. Today, increasingly complicated models are being proposed for a variety of correlated data such as temporal, spatial, and repeated measurement data. There is a gap between developing new modelling methods and model validation methods.  He is working on developing new residual diagnostic methods for checking the adequacy of statistical models. 


<h3>Statistical Machine Learning</h3> 

He aims to develop new tools for honestly measuring the predictivity (such as error rate, AUC) of selected features, and new tools for identifying truly predictive features and for building sharper predictive models for phenotypes. He is particularly interested in uncovering the molecular mechanisms behind Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.
