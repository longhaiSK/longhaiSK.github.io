<h1>Bayesian Classification and Regression with High Dimensional Features</h1>

<b><a target="_top" href="/index.html">Longhai Li</a></b>, Department of Math and Statistics, University of Saskatchewan

<p>This thesis responds to the challenges of using a large number, such
as thousands, of features in regression and classification problems. </p><p>There are two situations where such high dimensional features
arise. One is when high dimensional measurements are available, for
example, gene expression data produced by microarray techniques. For
computational or other reasons, people may select only a small subset
of features when modelling such data, by looking at how relevant the
features are to predicting the response, based on some measure such as
correlation with the response in the training data. Although it is used
very commonly, this procedure will make the response appear more
predictable than it actually is. In Chapter $2$, we propose a Bayesian
method to avoid this selection bias, with application to naive Bayes
models and mixture models. </p><p>High dimensional features also arise when we consider
high-order interactions. The number of parameters will increase
exponentially with the order considered. In Chapter $3$, we propose a
method for compressing a group of parameters into a single one, by
exploiting the fact that many predictor variables derived from
high-order interactions have the same values for all the training
cases. The number of compressed parameters may have converged before
considering the highest possible order. We apply this compression
method to logistic sequence prediction models and logistic
classification models. </p><p>We use both simulated data and real data to test our methods in both chapters.
