<h2>Overview of Longhai Li's Teaching Activities</h2>

<p>Prof. Li has taught a diverse array of statistics courses at the University of Saskatchewan, organized into four main areas: </p>

<ul>
<li>Introductory Statistics: STAT 242, STAT 244, STAT 245
<li>Applied Statistics:  STAT 345, STAT 348, STAT 848
<li>Probability/Statistical Theory: STAT 241, STAT 342, STAT 442, STAT 443/STAT 851, STAT 841
<li>Computational Statistics: STAT 812/STAT 420
</ul>

<p>His teaching is featured by incorporating cutting-edge computational/data science techniques and real-world examples into classes. 
<ul>	

<li>He introduces his students to computational tools such as R, R Markdown, and cloud storage for analyzing real datasets, developing statistical packages, and sharing analysis results. He has created web pages using R Markdown for all his classes on introductory and applied statistics and provided the source code for students to learn these tools. 

<li>He employs computational simulation and animation tools to elucidate statistical theorems and computer algorithms. 

<li>He is also committed to using real-world examples in his classes. For instance, he used data on <a href="https://longhaisk.github.io/teaching/stat342/Lec03.key.pdf#page=15">SK’s COVID-19 vaccination and hospitalization rates to demonstrate the power of Bayes' rule for understanding the efficacy of vaccination</a>. 
 

</ul>

<p>He actively involves undergraduate students in his research. In 2021, he led a team supported by MITACS to develop a public website that provides <a href="./CanadaCovidRt/">real-time reproduction rates for Canada’s national and provincial jurisdictions</a>. He has also involved undergraduate students in building R packages (e.g. <a href=" https://longhaisk.github.io/HTLR"><b>HTLR</a></b></a>) for statistical machine learning.
