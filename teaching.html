<h2>Summary</h2>

Prof. Li has taught a diverse array of statistics courses at the University of Saskatchewan, organized into three main areas:

<ul>
<li>Introductory and Applied Statistics: STAT 244, STAT 245, STAT 345, STAT 348, STAT 848
<li>Probability and Statistical Theory: STAT 241, STAT 242, STAT 342, STAT 442, STAT 443/STAT 851, STAT 841
<li>Computational Statistics: STAT 812/STAT 420
</ul>

Prof. Liâ€™s teaching is featured by the tncorportation of cutting-edge computational techniques and real-world examples into classes. He introduces his students tools such as R, R Markdown, and cloud storage for analyzing real datasets, developing statistical packages, and sharing analysis results. He has created web pages using R Markdown for all his classes on introductory and applied statistics and provided the source code for students to learn these tools.  He employs computational simulations and animation tools to elucidate statistical theory and computer algorithms for statistics. He is also committed to using real-world examples in his classes. He actively involves undergraduate students in his research.
