A researcher was interested in determining how or whether systolic and
diastolic blood pressures affect heart recovery rate after activity.

In the data set, 

Age: Age of the person
Systolic: Systolic blood pressure
Diastolic: Diastolic blood pressure
Recovery: the time for a person's heart rate recoved to normal,
after he/she exercised on a stationary bike until their heart rates reached
65% of their maximum heart rate.
