## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

If you want to write some math equation, you can type latex code like this `$$y_i^{(k)}=\log\left(\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n \exp\left(\sqrt{d_i^{(k)}}\right)}\right)$$`, which will give:
$$y_i^{(k)}=\log\left(\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n \exp\left(\sqrt{d_i^{(k)}}\right)}\right)$$

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
