<h1>STAT 850/442 Statistical Inference</h1> 

<h2> Description</h2>

This course presents a rigorous theoretical treatment of statistical inference, offering a comparative analysis of Bayesian, Likelihood, and Frequentist paradigms grounded in Decision Theory. Core topics include the geometry of Exponential Families and the principles of Data Reduction, utilizing Sufficiency and Completeness to derive Uniformly Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimators (UMVUE). The course further examines hypothesis testing through the Neyman-Pearson framework to construct Uniformly Most Powerful (UMP) tests, and concludes with the asymptotic theory of Maximum Likelihood, culminating in the derivation of Wilks’ Theorem and the geometry of likelihood-based inference.

<b></b>Prerequisite(s)</b>: STAT 342. 

This course requires a strong command of multivariate calculus, alongside a rigorous foundation in intermediate probability theory. Students should also possess prior exposure to applied statistical methods, particularly regression analysis.
