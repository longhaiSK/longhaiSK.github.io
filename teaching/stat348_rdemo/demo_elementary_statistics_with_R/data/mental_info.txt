Researcher was interested in the side effects of radiation therapy on
patents suffering cancerous lesions. In particular he was interested in the
effect of radiation therapy on Mental dexterity. Each patient was scored
(Pre.test) on a mental dexterity test prior to treatment. They were again
scored on a similar test (Post.Test) one month after treatment began.  

N1 = 16 were not given radiation and served as controls,
N2 = 19 were given radiation dosage in the range 25-50, 
N3 = 18 were given radiation dosage in the range 75-125, and 
N4 = 21 were given radiation dosage in the range 125-250. 

In the data set,

Pre.test: mental dexterity score before test
Post.test: mental dexterity score after test
Treat: indicator of dosage level
