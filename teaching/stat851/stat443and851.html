<h3 class="western"><strong>Evaluation Components</strong></h3>
<h4 class="western"><strong>Assignments</strong></h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p class="western">I will accept late assignments only for three (3) days beyond the due date. The penalty for your delay is 10 percentage points per day of lateness from the value of the assignment (including weekends). <strong>Extensions are only granted in rare instances (notably as a result of family or medical emergencies) and upon receipt of adequate documentation.</strong></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="western">Answer the questions in the order they appear in the assignment. Neatness is important.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="western">Solutions to problems are to be included. Hence, simple answers without work will receive few (or no!) marks.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="western">Most problems in statistics have a &ldquo;real-life&rdquo; basis. Hence, solutions should include not only numerical solutions but also a statement as to what the numbers say about the problem.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="western">The work handed in must not be an exact duplicate of others.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="western">Submitting Assignments: The assignment can be typed and/or handwritten. Save your assignment as <strong>one PDF file </strong>(for handwritten assignments, feel free to take a picture/scan of your <span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">work and save it as one PDF file). Upload the </span><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">PDF file </strong><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">as an assignment submission in Canvas.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p class="western">More details will be provided ahead of each assignment.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="western">Due Date: See Course Schedule.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4 class="western"><strong>Midterms</strong></h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p class="western">Each midterm is given in class period.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="western">Midterms must be written on the dates scheduled. Students must do midterms completely on their own. More details (including syllabus) will be provided ahead of each midterm.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Type: Short-answer questions, problem-solving, i open-book.</li>
    <li>
        <p class="western">Calculator: A scientific calculator is allowed.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="western">Make-up exam will not be given. If you miss an exam for a legitimate reason (e.g., illness, emergency) and notify me within 48 hours of the scheduled exam, the weight of the missed exam will be transferred to the final exam.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4 class="western"><strong>Final Exam</strong></h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p class="western">Scheduling: Final examinations may be scheduled at any time during the examination period; students should therefore avoid making prior travel, employment, or other commitments for this period. If a student is unable to write an exam through no fault of their own for medical or other valid reasons, documentation must be provided and an opportunity to write the missed exam may be given. Students are encouraged to review all examination policies and procedures: <a href="http://students.usask.ca/academics/exams.php"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://students.usask.ca/academics/exams.php</span></a><a href="http://students.usask.ca/academics/exams.php">.</a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="western">The final exam will cover material taken from the entire term. More details will be provided ahead of the exam.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="western">Length: 3-hour in-person exam.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="western">Type: Short-answer questions, problem-solving, i open-book.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3 class="western">Criteria That Must Be Met to Pass</h3>
<p class="western">The <strong>final exam is a required component of the course</strong>. Students must complete the final exam in order to be eligible to receive a passing grade in this class.</p>
<h3 class="western">Attendance Expectation</h3>
<p class="western">Attendance is highly correlated with student performance. While a syllabus and suggested readings are provided, it is not an adequate substitute for attending class. Your <strong>attendance is highly recommended </strong>but not required, and you will not be graded on your attendance.</p>
<h3 class="western">Recording of the Course</h3>
<p class="western">Recording of the lectures will only be allowed in certain circumstances. Please see the instructor for information on how to receive approval. In general, there will be no videos available for in-person lectures. Therefore, <strong>attendance is strongly recommended</strong>.</p>
