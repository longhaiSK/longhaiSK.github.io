# Preface {.unnumbered}

## **Overview** {.unnumbered}

This book has evolved from the lecture notes for *STAT 851: Statistical Linear Models*, a graduate-level course taught at the University of Saskatchewan. This course is a rigorous examination of the general linear models using vector space theory, in particular the approach of regarding least square as projection. The topics includes: vector space; projection; matrix algebra; generalized inverses; quadratic forms; theory for point estimation; theory for hypothesis test; theory for non-full-rank models.

The lectures were built upon the lecture notes for stat 8260 by Danniel Hall and the textbook LINEAR MODELS IN STATISTICS, Second Edition, by Alvin C. Rencher and G. Bruce Schaalje, ISBN 978-0-471-75498-5 (cloth)
