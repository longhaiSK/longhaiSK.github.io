## **Overview**

This book has evolved from the lecture notes for *STAT 851: Statistical Linear Models*, a graduate-level course taught at the University of Saskatchewan. This course is a rigorous examination of the general linear models using vector space theory, in particular the approach of regarding least square as projection. The topics includes: vector space; projection; matrix algebra; generalized inverses; quadratic forms; theory for point estimation; theory for hypothesis test; theory for non-full-rank models.
