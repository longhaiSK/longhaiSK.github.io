  abstract = {For differential abundance analysis, zero-inflated generalized linear models, typically zero-inflated NB models, have been increasingly used to model microbiome and other sequencing count data. A common assumption in estimating the false discovery rate is that the p values are uniformly distributed under the null hypothesis, which demands that the postulated model fit the count data adequately. Mis-specification of the distribution of the count data may lead to excess false discoveries. Therefore, model checking is critical to control the FDR at a nominal level in differential abundance analysis. Increasing studies show that the method of randomized quantile residual (RQR) performs well in diagnosing count regression models. However, the performance of RQR in diagnosing zero-inflated GLMMs for sequencing count data has not been extensively investigated in the literature.},

The typical output of a GWAS program includes a series of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and their significance. Currently, there is no standard way to compare results across different programs or to select the most 'significant' results uniformly and consistently. To obtain a comprehensive and accurate set of SNPs associated with a trait of interest, we present a novel automated pipeline that leverages machine learning for GWAS discoveries. The pipeline first performs population structure analysis, then executes multiple GWAS software and combines their results into a single SNP set. After that, it selects SNPs from the set with high individual and/or joint effects with the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator analysis. Finally, the predictivity of the model is assessed using cross-validation.},

  abstract = {Microbiome data consists of operational taxonomic unit (OTU) counts characterized by zero-inflation, over-dispersion, and grouping structure among samples. Currently, statistical testing methods are commonly performed to identify OTUs that are associated with a phenotype. The limitations of statistical testing methods include that the validity of p-values/q-values depend sensitively on the correctness of models and that the statistical significance does not necessarily imply predictivity. Predictive analysis using methods such as LASSO is an alternative approach for identifying associated OTUs and for measuring the predictability of the phenotype variable with OTUs and other covariate variables. We investigate three strategies of performing predictive analysis: (1) LASSO: fitting a LASSO multinomial logistic regression model to all OTU counts with specific transformation; (2) screening+GLM: screening OTUs with q-values returned by fitting a GLMM to each OTU, then fitting a GLM model using a subset of selected OTUs; (3) screening+LASSO: fitting a LASSO to a subset of OTUs selected with GLMM. We have conducted empirical studies using three simulation datasets generated using Dirichlet-multinomial models and a real gut microbiome data related to Parkinson's disease to investigate the performance of the three strategies for predictive analysis. Our simulation studies show that the predictive performance of LASSO with appropriate variable transformation works remarkably well on zero-inflated data. Our results of real data analysis show that Parkinson's disease can be predicted based on selected OTUs after the binary transformation, age, and sex with high accuracy (Error Rate = 0.199, AUC = 0.872, AUPRC = 0.912). These results provide strong evidences of the relationship between Parkinson's disease and the gut microbiome.},

  abstract = {Feature selection is demanded in many modern scientific research problems that use high-dimensional data. A typical example is to identify gene signatures that are related to a certain disease from high-dimensional gene expression data. The expression of genes may have grouping structures, for example, a group of co-regulated genes that have similar biological functions tend to have similar expressions. Thus it is preferable to take the grouping structure into consideration to select features. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian Robit regression method with Hyper-LASSO priors (shortened by BayesHL) for feature selection in high dimensional genomic data with grouping structure. The main features of BayesHL include that it discards more aggressively unrelated features than LASSO, and it makes feature selection within groups automatically without a pre-specified grouping structure. We apply BayesHL in gene expression analysis to identify subsets of genes that contribute to the 5-year survival outcome of endometrial cancer (EC) patients. Results show that BayesHL outperforms alternative methods (including LASSO, group LASSO, supervised group LASSO, penalized logistic regression, random forest, neural network, XGBoost and knockoff) in terms of predictive power, sparsity and the ability to uncover grouping structure, and provides insight into the mechanisms of multiple genetic pathways leading to differentiated EC survival outcome.},

  abstract = {Residuals in normal regression are used to assess a model's goodness-of-fit (GOF) and discover directions for improving the model. However, there is a lack of residuals with a characterized reference distribution for censored regression. In this article, we propose to diagnose censored regression with normalized randomized survival probabilities (RSP). The key idea of RSP is to replace the survival probability (SP) of a censored failure time with a uniform random number between 0 and the SP of the censored time. We prove that RSPs always have the uniform distribution on (0, 1) under the true model with the true generating parameters. Therefore, we can transform RSPs into normally distributed residuals with the normal quantile function. We call such residuals by normalized RSP (NRSP residuals). We conduct simulation studies to investigate the sizes and powers of statistical tests based on NRSP residuals in detecting the incorrect choice of distribution family and nonlinear effect in covariates. Our simulation studies show that, although the GOF tests with NRSP residuals are not as powerful as a traditional GOF test method, a nonlinear test based on NRSP residuals has significantly higher power in detecting nonlinearity. We also compared these model diagnostics methods with a breast-cancer recurrent-free time dataset. The results show that the NRSP residual diagnostics successfully captures a subtle nonlinear relationship in the dataset, which is not detected by the graphical diagnostics with CS residuals and existing GOF tests.},

  abstract = {Accurate model performance assessment in survival analysis is imperative for robust predictions and informed decision-making. Traditional residual diagnostic tools like martingale and deviance residuals lack a well-characterized reference distribution for censored regression, making numerical statistical tests based on these residuals challenging. Recently, the introduction of Z-residuals for diagnosing survival models addresses this limitation. However, concerns arise from conventional methods that use the entire dataset for both model parameter estimation and residual assessment, which may cause optimistic biases. This article introduces cross-validatory Z-residuals as an innovative approach to address these limitations. Employing a cross-validation (CV) framework, the method systematically partitions the dataset into training and testing sets to reduce the optimistic bias. Our simulation studies demonstrate that, for goodness-of-fit tests and outlier detection, cross-validatory Z-residuals are significantly more powerful (e.g., power increased from 0.2 to 0.6). and more discriminative (e.g., AUC increased from 0.58 to 0.85) than Z-residuals without CV. We also compare the performance of Z-residuals with and without CV in identifying outliers in a real application that models the recurrence time of kidney infection patients. Our findings suggest that cross-validatory Z-residuals can identify outliers, which Z-residuals without CV fail to identify. The CV Z-residual is a more powerful tool than the No-CV Z-residual for checking survival models, particularly in goodness-of-fit tests and outlier detection. We have published a generic function, which is collected in an R package called Zresidual, for computing CV Z-residual for the output of the widely used survival R package.},

  abstract = {Survival analysis often involves modeling hazard functions while considering frailty to account for unobserved cluster-level factors in clustered survival data. Shared frailty models have gained popularity for this purpose, but assessing covariate functional form in these models presents unique challenges. Martingale and deviance residuals are commonly used for visually assessing covariate functional form against continuous covariates. Nevertheless, their subjective nature and lack of a reference distribution make it challenging to derive numerical statistical tests from these residuals. To address these limitations, we propose `Z-residuals', a novel diagnostic tool designed for shared frailty models, leveraging the concept of randomized survival probability and introducing both graphical and numerical tests. To implement this approach, we develop an R package to compute Z-residuals for shared frailty models. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate the high power of our derived numerical test for assessing the functional form of covariates. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we apply it to a real data application concerning the modelling of survival time for acute myeloid leukemia patients. Our Z-residual diagnosis results reveal the inadequacy of log-transformation of the covariate, highlighting the limitations of other diagnostic methods for effectively assessing covariate functional form in shared frailty models.},

  abstract = {Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a common psychiatric disorder disease that typically causes impaired communication and compromised social interactions. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is one of the common neuroimaging modalities for understanding human brain functionalities as well as the diagnosis and treatment of brain disorders. There are many successful applications of deep learning to fMRI analytics where fMRI data is mostly considered structured Euclidean grids or time series, and features were usually extracted from the computer vision or time series perspective. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are neural networks that learn the interactions of graphs via message passing between the nodes of graphs. Recently variants of GNNs such as graph attention network (GAT) have demonstrated outstanding performances on many machine learning tasks. In this paper, we proposed a connectivity based graph attention network for autism diagnosis using functional connectivity (FC) patterns obtained from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). We define graphs based on F Cs and statistics of fMRI time series and present a connectivity-based GATs model for fMRI data analysis. The graph-theoretic based approach enables us to pass messages among connectomic (Non-Euclidean) neighborhoods, which is consistent with the brain functional networks. To evaluate the performance of our proposed GAT, we apply the GAT model to the classification of A SD patients from normal controls. Our results show that GAT can effectively capture salient features for ASD classifications in fMRI analysis.},

  abstract = {In modern neuroscience and clinical study, neuroscientists and clinicians often use non-invasive imaging techniques to validate theories and computational models, observe brain activities and diagnose brain disorders. The functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is one of the commonly-used imaging modalities that can be used to understand human brain mechanisms as well as the diagnosis and treatment of brain disorders. The advances in artificial intelligence and the emergence of deep learning techniques have shown promising results to better interpret fMRI data. Deep learning techniques have rapidly become the state of the art for analyzing fMRI data sets and resulted in performance improvements in diverse fMRI applications. Deep learning is normally presented as an end-to-end learning process and can alleviate feature engineering requirements and hence reduce domain knowledge requirements to some extent. Under the framework of deep learning, fMRI data can be considered as images, time series or images series. Hence, different deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural network, or a combination of both, can be developed to process fMRI data for different tasks. In this review, we discussed the basics of deep learning methods and focused on its successful implementations for brain disorder diagnosis based on fMRI images. The goal is to provide a high-level overview of brain disorder diagnosis with fMRI images from the perspective of deep learning applications.},
