	<h1> How to Install an R Package?</h1>

<h3><a target="_top" href="../index.html">Longhai Li</a>, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Saskatchewan </h3>

I occacionally publish R add-on packages for others to implement and test the statistical methodoglogies I discuss in my papers. R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics, available from <a target="_new" href="http://www.r-project.org">http://www.r-project.org</a>. The following is a brief instruction of installing R packages. More details can be found by typing <b>?INSTALL</b> in R console.

<h2>Install a new package to your computer </h2>

<h3>Method 1: Install from source</h3>

<p>Download the add-on R  package, say <b>mypkg</b>, and type the following command in Unix console to install it to <b>/my/own/R-packages/</b>: </p>

<p><b>$ R CMD INSTALL mypkg -l /my/own/R-packages/</b> </p>


<h3>Method 2: Install from CRAN directly</h3>

<p>Type the following command in R console to install it to <b>/my/own/R-packages/</b> directly from CRAN:

</p><p><b>&gt; install.packages("mypkg", lib="/my/own/R-packages/")</b> </p>

<h2>Load the library</h2>

Type the following command in R console to load the package<br>

<p><b>&gt; library("mypkg", lib.loc="/my/own/R-packages/")</b> </p>

<h2>Instructions of using R</h2>

If you are new to R, you can learn very quickly how to use R, following for example these introductions:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html">Official R manuals</a>
