<h2 style="text-align: center;">A LaTex Thesis Template</h2>

<p>Many people feel that using latex to write a thesis (or a book) is a
very challenging task.&nbsp; Using latex
to write a thesis is very easy. I distribute this thesis `template' to
demonstrate this. All format specification is written in file <a href="format.utthesis.tex">format.utthesis.tex</a>, which you can modify freely. I also give a template file <a href="thesis.temp.tex">thesis.1side.tex</a>
to show you how to use the previous format file. The previous two files
and other files to make up a toy thesis are compressed in <a href="utthesis.tar.gz">utthesis.tar.gz</a> or zipped file <a href="utthesis.zip">utthesis.zip</a>. </p>

<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">To U of S Graduate Students:</span><br>
<br>
There is another latex template package for thesis available, see <a href="http://www.cs.usask.ca/resources/tech_support/latex.php#thesisstyle" target="_blank">here</a>, which is more sophisticated, may be accredited by the College of Graduate Studies and Research. <br>
