Rejection Sampling (ARS)</a> is an efficient method for sampling from a 
target distribution whose log PDF is concave.&nbsp; The description of 
ARS by the original inventor (Wally Gilks) is as follows:<br></p><table style="text-align: left; background-color: rgb(204, 204, 204); margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 90%; height: 92px;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;"><p><i>ARS works by constructing an envelope 
function of the log of the target density, which is then used in 
rejection sampling. Whenever a point is rejected by ARS, the envelope is 
updated to correspond more closely to the true log density, thereby 
reducing the chance of rejecting subsequent points. Fewer ARS rejection 
steps implies fewer point-evaluations of the log density. Such 
evaluations are typically very expensive computationally in applications 
of Gibbs sampling.</i></p></td></tr></tbody></table> <p>This
method is very useful and conceptually simple. The original authors
provide a FORTRAN routine. However, it seemed to me that there wasn't a
C routine available. Therefore I posted this C function, which can be
called directly in R with .C function. <br>

you need only to include the file ars.c in your C code. See the following examples for demonstration.</p>

<h2>Pros of this software</h2>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"> <p> The target distribution can be
badly unnormalized as long as its log PDF values are not underflow.
This is convenient when the target distribution is a univariate
conditional distribution, whose value is known only to be some multiple
of the value of the joint distribution of all parameters, which is
typical in Gibbs sampling. This is realized by computing only the log
of target PDF and its derivative, and also only computing the log of
the integral under each piece of exponential linear function.
</p></li><li style="text-align: justify;"> <p> The bounds of target distribution can be defined <i>implicitly</i> in the function <i>eval_logf</i>, not necessarily specified in <i>lb</i> and <i>ub</i>.
This is realized by stepping out from the initial tangent point to both
directions until reaching a point with log PDF equal to -INFINITY (ie
reaching a point outside the bounds). The bounds will be further
refined as new point is drawn. This is convenient when the bounds
cannot be found in closed form but a point can be checked with a
condition whether still inside bounds, for example an interval along
one axis within an ellips. </p></li><li style="text-align: justify;"> <p> Only one initial
tangent point is required to start the program. More tangent points
will be found by stepping out from the first point until an upper hull
with finite integral is found.</p></li></ul><h2>Other Implementations of ARS</h2><h3>In pure R language </h3><ul><li><p><a href="http://actuaryzhang.com/seminar/topic5_ars.R" target="_blank">R function by<span style="font-family: Calibri,Arial,Verdana,Univers;"> </span>Yanwei (Wayne) Zhang</a></p></li><li><p><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ars/index.html" target="_blank">An R add-on Package</a></p></li></ul>
