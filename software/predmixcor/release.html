<h2>Description</h2>This R package is used to predict the binary
response based on high dimensional binary features modeled with
Bayesian mixture models. The model is trained with Gibbs sampling. A
smaller number of features can be selected based on the correlations
with the response. The bias due to the selection procedure can be
corrected. The software is written entirely with R language.
<p>The software is most suitable for analyzing the data with very high
dimension, for example the diagnosis of cancer based on the gene
expression data.
