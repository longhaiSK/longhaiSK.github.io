<h2>Description</h2>

This software predicts the binary response based on high dimemsional binary
features modeled with Bayesian mixture models. The model is trained with Gibbs
sampling. A smaller number of features can be selected based on the correlations
with the response. The bias due to the selection procedure can be corrected. The
software is written entirely with R language.

<p>The software is most suitable for analyzing the data with very high 
dimension, for example  the diagnosis of cancer based on the gene expression
data.

<h2>Installation</h2>

The software is written in C for Unix System and uses R as user interface. R is
a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics, available
from  <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</a>. You
need to install R and add this package.

<h3>Method 1: Install from source</h3>

R instruction for installing from source package can be found by typing
<b>?INSTALL</b> in R console. Simply, you need to do the following:

<p>Download the add-on R  package: <a
href="predmixcor_1.1-1.tar.gz">predmixcor_1.1-1.tar.gz</a>, and type the
following command in Unix console to install it to <b>/my/own/R-packages/</b>: 

<p><b>$ R CMD INSTALL -l /my/own/R-packages/ predmixcor_1.1-1.tar.gz</b> </p> 


<h3>Method 2: Install from CRAN</h3>

I also submit this package to <a
href="http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html">CRAN</a>, where Windows and Mac OS
X binary may be produced. However, I may make minor modification without
resubmitting it to CRAN. The source package and documentation released here are
the most recent.

<p>Type the following command in R console to install it to
<b>/my/own/R-packages/</b>:

<p><b>> install.packages("predmixcor", lib="/my/own/R-packages/")</b> </p>

<h2>Load the library</h2> 

Type the following command in R console to load the package<br>

<p><b>> library("predmixcor", lib.loc="/my/own/R-packages/")</b> </p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

After you have installed and libraried the package, type this command in R
console:

<p> <b>>?begin.predmixcor</b></p>

R will show up the first documentation I would like you to start to read. 

<p>The complete documentations are also available in html format: <a
href="00Index.html">Documentation for predmixcor_1.1-1</a>.
