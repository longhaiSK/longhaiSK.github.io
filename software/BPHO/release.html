<h2>Description</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>
This R package is used in two situations. The
first is to predict the next outcome based on the previous states of a
discrete sequence. The second is to classify a discrete response based
on a number of discrete covariates. In both situations, we use Bayesian
logistic regression models that consider the high-order interactions.
The time arising from using high-order interactions is reduced greatly
by our compression technique that represents a group of original
parameters as a single one in MCMC step. In this version, we use
log-normal prior for the hyperparameters. When it is used for the
second situation --- classification, we consider the full set of
interaction patterns up to a specified order.
