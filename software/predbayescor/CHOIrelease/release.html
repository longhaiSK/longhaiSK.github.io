<h2>Description</h2>

This software predicts the response with categorical features by learning from 
training data.  We take the high-order  interactions into account. We use a
compression technique to reduce the number of parameters  associated with
high-order interactions. The model is trained with a sort of Markov chain 
sampling method, called slice sampling, which is developed by Professor Radford
Neal in  University of Toronto. <br>

<h2>Install</h2>

The software is written in C for Unix System and uses R as user
interface. R is a free software environment 
for statistical computing and graphics, available from 
<a href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</a>. <br>
<p>
If you have installed R in your computer, then download the add-on R 
package: <a href="ClassHighOrderInteract_1.0.tar.gz">ClassHighOrderInteract_1.0.tar.gz</a> to 
a local directory. If you'd like to read the orginal .R and .c files 
download this tar file: <a href="ClassHighOrderInteract.ori.tar">ClassHighOrderInteract.ori.tar</a>

<p>
To install this package in your computer to somewhere, say <b>"myRlib"</b>, 
type the following command in Unix console: <br>

<p><b>$ R CMD INSTALL -l myRlib ClassHighOrderInteract_1.0.tar.gz</b>
</p> 
<h2>Load the library</h2>
Type the following command in R console you start up in 
whichever directory to load the package<br>
<p><b>> library("ClassHighOrderInteract", lib.loc="myRlib")</b>
</p>
<p>
<h2>Help Documentation</h2>
After you have installed and libraried the package, in R console, type
<p> <b>> ?comp_train_pred_interact</b> 

</p>
R will show up the documentation as shown by 
<a href="00Index.html">help file in html format</a>.
