<h2>Description</h2>

This R package is used to predict the binary response based on high dimensional binary 
features with Bayesian naive Bayes models. The software also accepts real 
values but they will be converted into binary by thresholding at the medians 
estimated from the data. A small number of features can be selected based on 
the correlations with the response. The bias due to this selection can be 
corrected.

<p>A short-cut function for doing cross-validation with the classifier is also 
provided.

</p><p>The software is most suitable for analyzing the data with very high 
dimension, for example  the diagnosis of cancer based on the gene expression
data.

<h2>Examples of classification with Colon gene expression data</h2>

<p>The original real-valued colon data of R format:  <a href="colon.rda">colon.rda</a>. The binary colon data of R format:  <a href="colon.bin.rda">colon.bin.rda</a>. There are 62 patients (40 vs 22)  and
2000 genes. They can be loaded into R workspace by using "load" function:

</p><p><b> &gt; load("colon.bin.rda")</b> 

</p><p> Test how well the above method with leave-one-out crossvalidation: 

</p><p><b> &gt;cv.bayes(colon.bin,T,62,4,0.4,30,0.8,5,30,T,40)</b>

</p><p>Results:<br> The result of above R command is shown by <a href="cv-colon-result"> cv-colon-result</a>. The error rate of above analysis is
0.0967742, i.e. 6 out 62 cases were  misclassified. This is the lowest error
rate for Colon data (compared to <a href="http://www-stat.stanford.edu/%7Etibs/PAM/comparison.html"> the results collected by Prof. Tibshirani</a>).  We selected only 4 features out of 2000
for each iteration in cross-validation.  Our method is also very fast, taking
totally 103 secs for 62 folds  crossvalidation, which includes also the time for
feature selection.  One more thing, our method is also pretty simple
conceptually.
